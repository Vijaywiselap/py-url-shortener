# Py-URL-Shortener
Py URL Shortener is a Python powered Flask app implementing a technique in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) has been made substantially shorter in length and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect on a domain name that is short, which links to the web page that has a long URL.
