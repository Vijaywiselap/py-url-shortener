This is achieved by using a redirect on a domain name that is short, which links to the web page that has a long URL.\r\n\r\n**Demo:** https://github.com/ugcoder/Py-URL-Shortener/wiki/Screenshots\r\n#What have been used?\r\n\r\n- **Python3:** Yah! It's high time we should use Python3 instead of Python2 and I have started the journey already.\r\n\r\n- **Flask:** Flask is a microframework for Python based on [Werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/), [Jinja 2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/)  and good intentions. And before you ask: It's [BSD licensed](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)!\r\n\r\n- **Flask-SQLAlchemy:** Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that adds support for [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)  to your application. It requires SQLAlchemy 0.6 or higher. It aims to simplify using SQLAlchemy with Flask by providing useful defaults and extra helpers that make it easier to accomplish common tasks.\r\n\r\n- **Flask-WTF:** Flask-WTF offers simple integration with [WTForms](http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/docs/).\r\n\r\n- **PyMySQL:** This package contains a pure-Python MySQL client library. The goal of PyMySQL is to be a drop-in replacement for MySQLdb and work on CPython, PyPy and IronPython.\r\n\r\n- **MarkupSafe:** MarkupSafe is a library for Python that implements a unicode string that is aware of HTML escaping rules and can be used to implement automatic string escaping. It is used by [Jinja 2](jinja.pocoo.org), the [Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) templating engine, the [Pylons](http://pylonshq.com/) web framework and many more.\r\n\r\n#Database\r\n\r\n**Py-URL-Shortener** is tested with [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) and obviously can be used with [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/). And as we are using [Flask-SQLAlchemy](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.1/), you can combine it with any database system supported by [Flask-SQLAlchemy](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.1/).\r\n\r\n#Userâ€™s Guide\r\n\r\n- [Requirements](https://github.com/ugcoder/Py-URL-Shortener/wiki/Requirements)\r\n\r\n- [Installation](https://github.com/ugcoder/Py-URL-Shortener/wiki/Installation) \r\n\r\n- [Configuration](https://github.com/ugcoder/Py-URL-Shortener/wiki/Configuration) \r\n\r\n- [Screenshots](https://github.com/ugcoder/Py-URL-Shortener/wiki/Screenshots)\r\n\r\n- [API](https://github.com/ugcoder/Py-URL-Shortener/wiki/API) \r\n\r\n- [Deployment](https://github.com/ugcoder/Py-URL-Shortener/wiki/Deployment) ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
